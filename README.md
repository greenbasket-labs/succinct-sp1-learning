# Succinct SP1 Learning

This repository is my personal learning journey with
**Succinct SP1**, a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM).

I am learning:
- What zero-knowledge proofs are
- How SP1 proves normal Rust programs
- How zkVMs are used in real blockchain systems

This is a learning-first repository.
I will add examples slowly as I understand them.

Status: Learning in progress 🚧
