# Succinct SP1 zkVM – Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey with the Succinct SP1 zkVM.

The goal of this project is not to ship a production system, but to
understand zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) from an infrastructure
and developer perspective.

## Focus
- Learn what zkVMs are and why they matter
- Understand the SP1 model at a high level
- Document concepts, progress, and challenges
- Build public proof of learning in zero-knowledge infrastructure

## Scope
- Conceptual learning and documentation
- No production code yet
- No prover nodes or heavy computation at this stage

## Status
Active learning project.

This repository is intentionally simple and honest.
