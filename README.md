# Succinct SP1 zkVM – Learning Project

This repository contains a minimal zero-knowledge program built while learning
the **Succinct SP1 zkVM**.

## What this demonstrates
- Writing zk programs in Rust using SP1
- Generating zero-knowledge proofs for program execution
- Understanding zkVM-based proving infrastructure

## Program
- **Fibonacci** – computes the nth Fibonacci number and proves correct execution

## Why this matters
Succinct enables developers to generate verifiable proofs of computation
that can be verified on Ethereum, L2s, Solana, and beyond.

This repo is part of my ongoing work learning **ZK infrastructure** and
privacy-preserving computation.

Built with ❤️ while learning Succinct.
