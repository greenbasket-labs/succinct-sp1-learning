# SP1 zkVM – Basics

## What is a zkVM?
A zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) allows programs to be executed and
verified without revealing the underlying inputs.

Instead of trusting execution, a verifier checks a cryptographic proof that
the computation was done correctly.

## What is SP1?
SP1 is Succinct’s zkVM that allows developers to write programs in Rust and
generate zero-knowledge proofs of execution.

The focus of SP1 is performance, developer experience, and general-purpose
computation.

## Why zkVMs Matter
- Enable verifiable computation
- Reduce trust assumptions
- Allow complex logic to be proven on-chain or off-chain

## Current Understanding
At this stage, learning is focused on concepts rather than implementation.

## Open Questions
- Resource requirements for local proving
- Best entry point for first proof generation
- Tradeoffs between zkVMs and circuit-based ZK
