# Progress Log — Succinct SP1 zkVM

This document tracks my learning progress, understanding gaps, and next actions while studying zero-knowledge proofs using Succinct’s SP1 zkVM.

This is a **learning log**, not a product roadmap.

---

## Completed

- Repository created and structured
- Development environment set up
  - VS Code
  - GitHub
- Initial review of Succinct SP1 documentation
- High-level understanding of:
  - What a zkVM is
  - Why zkVMs are useful
  - How SP1 differs from circuit-based ZK systems

---

## In Progress

- Studying SP1 architecture and execution model
- Understanding:
  - Program execution inside the zkVM
  - Prover responsibilities
  - Verifier responsibilities
- Mapping zkVM concepts to traditional execution models

---

## Open Questions / Notes

- How SP1 handles constraints internally
- Tradeoffs between zkVMs and hand-written circuits
- Performance implications of general-purpose zkVMs
- Best practices for structuring SP1 programs

---

## Next Steps

- Write structured notes on SP1 fundamentals
- Document SP1 proving and verification flow
- Run and study a minimal SP1 example
- Record learnings and limitations discovered during experimentation
